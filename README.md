# Razor Start Bootstrap Admin

This is an adaptation of [StartBootrap](https://startbootstrap.com/)'s [free Bootsrap 5 admin template](https://startbootstrap.com/template/sb-admin) into an [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) [Razor Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/) project.

It uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager and [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to bundle JavaScript and SCSS frontend assets.
